MissingOutputException in line 26 of /mnt/xio/botany/Aman/vasuki/snakemake/rules/filter_plant_reads.smk:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
../results_test/unmapped/B001.sam completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 3
Removing output files of failed job filter_plant_reads since they might be corrupted:
../results_test/unmapped/B002.sam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
